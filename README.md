- `ps-list` (via `utils/pslist-wrapper.mjs`) provides process snapshots for auto-selection and playtime tracking
- Interval timers (~2s) keep dashboard cards and playtime state up to date

## 🎮 Setup & Configuration

### Quick Start (Tutorial)

1. Open **Settings** and set Preset, and Scale.
2. Add your **Watched Folders** (recommended) so the app can detect saves/emulators.
3. Start a game once so its save folder appears; the watcher will auto-create a config when possible.
4. Let the game identify and auto-select the config, or Select the config manually, set your Language to view achievements, progress, and playtime.
5. Optional: mute progress notifications for that config using the checkbox under the config dropdown.

### First-Run Onboarding (Auto-Config Gate)

- On first run (or after onboarding version changes), startup pauses and shows a folder selection modal before full auto-scan starts.
- The app searches for known achievement/save signals (for example `achievements.json`, `achievements.ini`, `stats.bin`, emulator trophy/gpd files) and lists candidate folders.
- **Start Auto-Config** keeps selected folders active and mutes unchecked discovered folders, then continues startup and background config generation.
- **Skip and mute all** continues startup immediately and mutes discovered/default auto-config roots.
- While onboarding is pending, folder watchers and boot auto-config scans are deferred by design to avoid unwanted automatic generation.
- Onboarding completion state is saved in `%APPDATA%/Achievements/preferences.json` (`autoConfigOnboardingCompleted`, `autoConfigOnboardingVersion`, `autoConfigOnboardingCompletedAt`).
- If the modal is not visible but startup is gated, use tray action **Resume Startup (Mute all)**.

### Basic Setup

#### Manual Configuration

1. Create a new config with:
   - **Name**: Your preferred identifier
   - **AppID**: Steam AppID or folder name for achievements
   - **Config Path**: Location of achievements.json and images / Leave empty to generate
   - **Save Path**: Where achievement progress is stored
   - **Executable** (optional): Direct path to game executable
   - **Arguments** (optional): Launch parameters
   - **Process Name** (optional): Specific .exe name to monitor
   - _Note_: Names are sanitized (illegal filename characters removed, condensed spacing) before saving; the sanitized name is used on disk and for playtime totals.

**Config JSON fields (reference):**

- `appid` (string) – game id
- `platform` (string) – steam/uplay/gog/gog-official/epic/epic-official/xenia/rpcs3/shadps4/steam-official/ubisoft-official/ea-official
- `config_path` (string) – folder containing `achievements.json` and `img/`
- `save_path` (string) – location of save/achievement progress
- `process_name` (string) – executable name for process tracking
- `executable` / `arguments` (optional) – used for Launch

_Note_: If `config_path` points to a custom location, schema regeneration/cleanup will not overwrite that folder.

#### Auto Configuration

1. Use **Watched Folders** (recommended) to scan your emulator/save directories.
2. The app will:
   - detect AppIDs and platform,
   - fetch game name + schema,
   - download achievement data and images when available,
   - generate configs automatically.
3. Default watched folders include:
   - %PUBLIC%\Documents\Steam\CODEX
   - %PUBLIC%\Documents\Steam\RUNE
   - %PUBLIC%\Documents\OnlineFix
   - %PUBLIC%\Documents\EMPRESS
   - %APPDATA%\Goldberg SteamEmu Saves
   - %APPDATA%\Goldberg UplayEmu Saves
   - %APPDATA%\GSE Saves
   - %APPDATA%\EMPRESS
   - %LOCALAPPDATA%\anadius\LSX emu\achievement_watcher
   - %APPDATA%\Steam\CODEX
   - %APPDATA%\SmartSteamEmu
   - %LOCALAPPDATA%\SKIDROW

**Note**: Auto-configuration uses the Steam Web API when a key is provided in Settings. Without a key, it falls back to SteamDB/SteamHunters + Languages from Exophase.
Sources used when available: Steam Web API, SteamDB, SteamHunters, Exophase, GOG, Epic.

#### Xenia-Canary Support

1. Open Xenia and create a User Profile.
2. Use **Watched Folders** add the 'Xenia Location'\Content/xxxxxx/xxxx/xxxx/xxxxxx' folder which is created after the Account is created in Xenia.
3. Start and play the game.
4. The app will:
   - read the file Xenia created,
   - fetch game name, schema and images.
   - generate configs automatically.
   - when new achievement is unlocked display the notifications.

#### RPCS3 Support

1. Use **Watched Folders** add the 'RPCS3 Location\dev_hdd0\home\xxxxxxx\trophy' folder which is created after the RPCS3 is configured.
2. Start and play the game.
3. The app will:
   - read the file RPCS3 created,
   - fetch game name, schema and images.
   - generate configs automatically.
   - when new achievement is unlocked display the notifications.

#### ShadPS4 Support

1. Use **Watched Folders** and add the ShadPS4 root folder: `%APPDATA%\shadPS4`.
2. Start and play the game so ShadPS4 creates the trophy schema and user progress files.
3. The app will:
   - read the schema from `%APPDATA%\shadPS4\trophy\<NPWR>\Xml`,
   - copy trophy icons from `%APPDATA%\shadPS4\trophy\<NPWR>\Icons`,
   - read unlock progress from `%APPDATA%\shadPS4\home\<userId>\trophy\<NPWR>.xml`,
   - map NPWR trophy IDs to CUSA game IDs when local ShadPS4 logs or legacy data provide the mapping,
   - generate configs automatically,
   - keep separate achievement cache files per ShadPS4 user,
   - detect user switches by monitoring all local user progress XML files for the selected game,
   - display notifications when new achievements are unlocked.

**Important notes:**

- Modern ShadPS4 storage is based on `%APPDATA%\shadPS4\trophy\<NPWR>` for schema/icons and `%APPDATA%\shadPS4\home\<userId>\trophy\<NPWR>.xml` for progress.
- Legacy ShadPS4 storage under `%APPDATA%\shadPS4\game_data\<CUSA>\TrophyFiles\trophy00` is still supported, but the modern trophy/progress layout is preferred when both exist.
- If multiple ShadPS4 users exist, caches are scoped per user so switching users does not overwrite another user's achievement state.

#### Steam Launcher Support

1. Use **Watched Folders** add the 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\appcache\stats' folder.
2. Start and play the game via Steam.
3. The app will:
   - read the file Steam created,
   - fetch game name, schema and images.
   - generate configs automatically.
   - when new achievement is unlocked display the notifications.

#### Epic Games Launcher Support

1. Connect an Epic account in **Settings** and use **Import Library** to pull owned games.
2. The app imports owned titles with achievements as `epic-official` configs automatically.
3. Local detection uses Epic manifest files to resolve install location, executable path and process name when the game is installed.
4. Polling runs only for the detected running Epic game, or for an Epic Official config explicitly selected by the user.
5. The dashboard reads the local achievement cache; it does not run a full Epic sync just to render the grid.

**Important notes:**

- `epic-official` configs are auto-generated and are not meant to be created manually from the platform dropdown.
- The import flow relies on Epic login and local encrypted token storage.
- Store images are resolved through Epic product metadata first, then fall back to SteamGridDB only when Epic metadata cannot provide a usable image.

#### GOG Galaxy Launcher Support

1. Install and sign in to **GOG Galaxy**.
2. Use **Watched Folders** add the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GOG.com\Galaxy\Applications` folder.
3. Start and play the game via GOG Galaxy at least once.
4. The app will:
   - resolve the local `clientId -> productId -> game title` mapping from `%ProgramData%\GOG.com\Galaxy\storage\galaxy-2.0.db`,
   - watch `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GOG.com\Galaxy\Applications\<clientId>\Gameplay\<userId>\gameplay.db`,
   - generate a `gog-official` config automatically,
   - build `achievements.json` and `achievementpercentages.json` locally from `gameplay.db`,
   - monitor later changes in `gameplay.db` and display notifications when new achievements are unlocked.

**Important notes:**

- `gog-official` is auto-generated from local GOG Galaxy data. It is not meant to be created manually from the platform dropdown.
- The config is created only after `gameplay.db` exists and the achievement table is populated and stable, to avoid generating an empty schema.
- If a game only has `Storage\...` data and no `Gameplay\<userId>\gameplay.db` yet, the app will detect the install path but will wait before creating the config.
- After creation, the config `save_path` points to the concrete `Gameplay\<userId>` folder, while runtime progress is read from `gameplay.db`.

#### Ubisoft Connect Launcher Support

1. Install and sign in to **Ubisoft Connect**.
2. Use **Watched Folders** add the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Ubisoft Game Launcher\spool` folder manually.
3. Start and play the game via Ubisoft Connect at least once so the local spool/cache files exist.
4. The app will:
   - detect `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Ubisoft Game Launcher\spool\<userId>\<productId>.spool`,
   - generate `achievements.json`, `achievementpercentages.json` and local images from `%ProgramData%\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\cache\achievements`,
   - generate a `ubisoft-official` config automatically,
   - use the local `uplay-steam` mapping when a Steam AppID is available for rarity,
   - monitor later `.spool` changes and display notifications when new achievements are unlocked.

**Important notes:**

- `ubisoft-official` is auto-generated from manually watched Ubisoft Connect spool roots. It is not meant to be created manually from the platform dropdown.
- The app does not assume the Ubisoft spool path automatically; the spool root must be added manually in **Settings → Folders**.
- The config is created only after both the `.spool` file and the local achievements archive are available, so the schema can be generated first.
- After creation, the config `save_path` points to the concrete `spool\<userId>` folder, while runtime progress is read from `<productId>.spool`.

#### EA Desktop Launcher Support

1. Install and sign in to **EA Desktop**.
2. Use **Watched Folders** add the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Electronic Arts\EA Desktop\Logs` folder manually.
3. Start and play the game via EA Desktop at least once so `EADesktopVerbose.log` contains the local achievement query for that game.
4. The app will:
   - read `EADesktopVerbose.log`,
   - resolve the local `contentId -> achievementSet -> game title` mapping from the EA Desktop verbose log,
   - generate `achievements.json` and local images from the achievement set logged by EA Desktop,
   - generate an `ea-official` config automatically,
   - monitor later verbose log changes and display notifications when new achievements are unlocked.

**Important notes:**

- `ea-official` is auto-generated from manually watched EA Desktop log roots. It is not meant to be created manually from the platform dropdown.
- The app does not assume the EA Desktop logs path automatically; the logs root must be added manually in **Settings → Folders**.
- The config is created only after EA Desktop has logged a full achievement set for that game, so the schema can be generated first.
- After creation, the config `save_path` points to the EA Desktop `Logs` folder, while runtime progress is read from `EADesktopVerbose.log`.
- EA Desktop can rotate `EADesktopVerbose.log` into `EADesktopVerbose.bak`; the app reads both so achievement events are not lost across log rotation.

### Game Compatibility

- Works best with games in Borderless window mode
  [Note: Games using DirectX 9/10/11 require Borderless/Borderless Windowed mode to be enabled via in-game display settings in order for notifications to show above the game window]
- Limited support for Fullscreen mode
  [Note: If a game supports and runs using DirectX 12, notifications will usually show above the game window when Fullscreen is enabled]
- Automatically detects and imports existing achievements
- Supports multiple achievement languages if available in Config

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Workarounds

- Match privilege level between app and game (`non-admin/non-admin` or `admin/admin`) for more reliable overlay and shortcut behavior.
- If overlay shortcut does not trigger in a specific game, switch to a 3-key combo and test `Ctrl+PageUp` / `Ctrl+PageDown` fallback.
- Overlay drag may fail in elevated/protected game contexts; use snap positions (`Ctrl+Alt+Shift+1..5`) or nudge (`Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Arrow Keys`) instead.
- Native PlayStation controller support for the overlay depends on Microsoft GameInput. Without it, only Xbox/XInput-compatible controllers are available for the overlay controller feature.
- In some engine/driver combinations, overlay z-order can vary (may appear behind windows); retoggle overlay and prefer Borderless Windowed mode.
- Flip/compositor behavior is controlled by Windows + GPU driver; app cannot force a single flip mode across all systems.
- Toggle **Disable Hardware Acceleration** (restart required) and keep the mode that is most stable for your setup. If the overlay hotkey works but nothing is visible, turn **Disable Hardware Acceleration** off (enable hardware acceleration) and restart the app.
- If overlay display/presentation issues appear, especially when **Special K** is also active, enable **Force globalShortcut for overlay**. This switches overlay shortcuts to Electron `globalShortcut`, disables hook-based drag, and can resolve compatibility/composition issues on affected systems.
- Notifications are queue-based; long preset durations can cause perceived delay. Reduce **Notification Duration** if needed.
- Presets with expensive effects (blur/backdrop + layered animation) can micro-stutter on some GPUs; use lighter presets if needed.
- Avoid running multiple overlay/injector tools at the same time when troubleshooting display/focus issues.
